# MyReads Project

This is MyReads app result of  the first assignment of the Udacity's React Nanodegree. The app is a private library where one can classify books among 3 categories (Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read). The app also has a page for searches where one can find books to include in private library. 

Besides the default requirements for the completion of the assignment, it was added an simple animation with Semantic-Ui-React when books change from a shelf to another one. 

This app was created with the awesome Create-React-App project (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
